    #      V4 : This version allows to estimate setup  "off main road"  for  // swing bellow 9V & // Low=-6 V
    #                                   
    # goal          : provide the various e2v voltages implied by a set of "free" parameters
    # input         : 4 "free" parameters that can be set independently the one from the others and that will
    #                  fix all the other e2v voltages 
    # 1)        PL  : Parallel Clock Low voltage 
    #                 default value : -6 V 
    #                 - Lower the value is better the serial CTE will be, also low value allow a more 
    #                   efficient holes uniformisation  / improve Rabbits ears - devisadiro effect
    #                 -  The lowest acceptable value , for safety raison ( avoid current in the bulk )  is -6V 
    #                 as this value already includes a huge  margins , it is a reasonnable default value. 
    # 2)        Pswing :  Parallel swing 
    #                  default value : 10.5 V
    #                 - higher the value is , better will be the full well and lower will be the BF effect
    #                 - the REB / power supply set 10.5 V as a reasonnable maximum ( even if e2v device have all
    #                    bin tested at 11V by e2v ... they implemented the complex 4 // phases configuration to 
    #                   allow a large usefull fullwell )
    #                 - Noise for fast-// clock rate - large swing has been observed in BOT - SLAC power supply
    #                    , the current cure is to limit the Pswing to 9.6 V ( hopefully a change in // clock sequence
    #                    could fix this as well , and will allow to increase  Pswing )
    #                 - large Pswing is bad for tearing ... the current limit for this reason is // swing = 9.3 V
    # 3)       Sswing   : Serial swing
    #                  default = 9.5 V
    #                  - A minimal value is 9 V
    #                  - For a conservative reason we use 9.3 V in the focal plane for years 
    #                  - e2v recommand 9.5 V and this value was used in all sensor qualification .
    # 4)       RGswing   : Reset Gate Swing
    #                  default Value   : 10.5 V
    #                  - What really matter for RG is the value of RG up which is not affected by the choice of
    #                    RGswing in this code.
    #                  - RGswing is only used to set RGlow, which has some freedom . In e2v setup RGswing is set 
    #                    to 12.5 V , but value as low as 10V should be fine , at the moment RG up is set correctly
    #                  - In the cold the REB can only deliver a swing up to 10.7 V

    # register when going to bi-polar , which is good for the noise.
